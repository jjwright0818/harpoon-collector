# Harpoon AI Trading System

## Overview
This AI system analyzes Polymarket data to provide real-time trading recommendations with weighted accuracy metrics.

## Files

### Core Files
- **`realtime_trading_agent.py`** - Main AI agent that analyzes current market data and provides BUY recommendations
- **`weighted_buy_trainer.py`** - Trainer that creates AI models using real Polymarket API data with weighted accuracy metrics
- **`weighted_buy_model.pkl`** - Trained AI model (100 markets, 9.2 minutes training, 58.3% weighted accuracy)

### Integration
- **`site_integration.py`** - Integration code for website deployment
- **`requirements.txt`** - Python dependencies

## How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- Fetches political markets from Polymarket API
- Collects 100+ markets with $100k+ volume
- Validates all data thoroughly with retry logic

### 2. AI Training
- Uses Random Forest Classifier with 32 features
- Includes flow analysis (price momentum, volume spikes, volatility)
- Weighted accuracy metrics that consider confidence scores
- Only provides BUY recommendations (no SELL/HOLD)

### 3. Real-Time Analysis
- Loads pre-trained model
- Analyzes current Supabase data
- Provides specific recommendations:
  - **Action**: BUY YES or BUY NO
  - **Price**: Exact price to buy at
  - **Confidence**: AI confidence in the recommendation
  - **Expected Return**: Potential profit if outcome wins

## Usage

### Train New Model
```bash
python3 ai/weighted_buy_trainer.py
```

### Run Real-Time Analysis
```bash
python3 ai/realtime_trading_agent.py
```
